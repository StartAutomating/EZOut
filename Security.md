As EZOut is a build tool, we take security fairly seriously.

No command in EZOut should be attempting to communicate with network resources, and no formatters shipped with EZOut are malicious.

If you have a concern to report, please [file a bug](https://github.com/StartAutomating/EZOut/issues/new?template=Bug.yml).
